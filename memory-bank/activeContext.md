# Active Context - AI System Administrator Agent

## Current Focus
✅ **PROJECT COMPLETED** - Successfully created a complete AI-powered system administrator agent for Raspberry Pi 5 deployment. All requirements have been implemented and the system is ready for deployment.

## Completed Implementation
1. ✅ **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure with all necessary files
2. ✅ **Technology Integration**: AutoGen + Qwen2 1.5B fully integrated and tested
3. ✅ **Installation Scripts**: Automated setup scripts for Pi deployment
4. ✅ **Agent Architecture**: Complete system administrator agent with conversation flow
5. ✅ **Security Framework**: Command validation, audit logging, and safety restrictions
6. ✅ **User Interfaces**: CLI, Web UI, and REST API interfaces
7. ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, troubleshooting guide, and deployment summary
8. ✅ **Testing**: Complete test suite and validation procedures

## Key Implementation Details
- **Project Location**: `/Users/inggo/Documents/ai-sysadmin-agent` (local development)
- **Target Deployment**: `/home/inggo/ai-agent` on Raspberry Pi 5 (meatpi)
- **AI Framework**: AutoGen for orchestration with full integration
- **LLM Backend**: Qwen2 1.5B with llama.cpp, optimized for ARM64
- **Security Model**: Non-root execution with comprehensive command whitelisting
- **Interfaces**: CLI (Rich), Web UI (FastAPI), REST API, WebSocket support

## Technical Architecture
- **Core Agent**: `SysAdminAgent` class with AutoGen integration
- **Security Layer**: Command validation, audit logging, resource limits
- **Execution Engine**: Safe system command execution with timeout controls
- **Model Backend**: llama.cpp with Qwen2 1.5B quantized model
- **Service Management**: Systemd service with health checks and monitoring

## Security Features Implemented
- **Command Whitelisting**: Only approved commands can execute
- **Pattern Detection**: Blocks dangerous command patterns (rm -rf /, sudo su, etc.)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking with structured logs
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time controls
- **File System Restrictions**: Limited access to sensitive directories
- **Network Security**: Firewall configuration and local-only communication

## Deployment Options
1. **Direct Installation**: Automated install script with systemd service
2. **Docker Deployment**: Containerized with docker-compose
3. **Remote Deployment**: Automated deployment from development machine

## Project Status
- **Phase**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Progress**: 100% - All features implemented and tested
- **Ready for**: Deployment to Raspberry Pi 5 (meatpi)
- **Next Action**: Deploy using `./scripts/deploy.sh` or manual installation

## Files Created
- **Core Application**: 15+ Python modules with full functionality
- **Configuration**: YAML configs for agent, security, and interfaces
- **Scripts**: Installation, testing, model setup, and deployment scripts
- **Documentation**: README, troubleshooting guide, deployment summary
- **Docker**: Complete containerization setup
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite with unit tests

## Ready for Production Use
The AI System Administrator Agent is now complete and ready for deployment on your Raspberry Pi 5 server. All requirements have been met including AutoGen integration, Qwen2 1.5B backend, security restrictions, multiple interfaces, and comprehensive documentation.
